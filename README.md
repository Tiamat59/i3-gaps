# i3-gaps settings

This is my current i3-gaps config files.
In my current config i have many places with total path "/home/mathisen" so pls take a close look
on what you need to edit if you plan to use it.

Also in my i3blocks.conf i have simple commands to fetch cpu temp and ip for my motherboard so 
also look there for what you need to edit.
